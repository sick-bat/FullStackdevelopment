        some constants internally is an implementation detail. Implementing a constant
        interface causes this implementation detail to leak into the class’s exported API. It
        is of no consequence to the users of a class that the class implements a constant
        interface. In fact, it may even confuse them. Worse, it represents a commitment: if
        in a future release the class is modified so that it no longer needs to use the
        constants, it still must implement the interface to ensure binary compatibility. If a
        nonfinal class implements a constant interface, all of its subclasses will have their
        namespaces polluted by the constants in the interface.</pre>
